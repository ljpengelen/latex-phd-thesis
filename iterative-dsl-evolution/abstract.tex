\begin{abstract}
In this chapter, we describe the evolution of the Simple Language of Communicating Objects (\SLCO) and the corresponding model transformations.
These transformations were developed one at the time, simultaneously with the language itself, while preserving the validity of the previously developed ones.
The simultaneous development of the language and the transformations has led to an iterative evolution of \SLCO.
Furthermore, the description of the semantics of \SLCO changed from a transformational definition to a definition based on an executable state-space generator.
Afterwards, a formal definition of its semantics was given.
Switching from one form of defining the semantics to another also led to adaptations of the language.
In this chapter, we describe our development process and the causes for the evolution of the language and its transformations.
