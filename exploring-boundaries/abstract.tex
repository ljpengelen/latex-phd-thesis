Traditionally, the state-space explosion problem in model checking is handled by applying abstractions and simplifications to the model that needs to be verified.
In this chapter, we propose an approach that applies model-driven software engineering and works the other way around.
Instead of making a concrete model more abstract, we propose to refine an abstract model to make it more concrete.
Furthermore, we propose to use fine-grained sequences of model transformations to enable model checking of models that are as close to the implementation model as possible.
We applied our approach in a case study.
The results show that it is possible to validate models that are more concrete when fine-grained sequences of transformations are applied.
