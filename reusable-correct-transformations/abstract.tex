Correctness of model transformations is a prerequisite for generating correct implementations from models.
Given refining model transformations that preserve desirable properties, models can be transformed into correct-by-construction implementations.
However, proving that model transformations preserve properties is far from trivial.
Therefore, we aim for simple correctness proofs by designing sequences of model transformations for automated code generation that are as fine-grained as possible.
Furthermore, we advocate the reuse of model transformations to reduce the number of proofs.
For a simple domain-specific modeling language, \SLCO, we define a formal framework to reason about the correctness, reusability, and composition of the model transformations used to transform a given model to three target languages: \NQC, \Promela, and \POOSL.
The correctness criterion induces that the systems specified by the original model and the resulting model obtained after a proper sequence of transformations have the same observable behavior.
