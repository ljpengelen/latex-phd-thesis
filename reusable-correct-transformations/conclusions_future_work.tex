\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:reusable-correct-transformations:conclusions}
To address research question~\RQ{4}, we defined a formal framework for reasoning about the correctness of the endogenous model transformations related to \SLCO, which is illustrated in this chapter.
Using this framework, we can assess whether sequences of transformations are well-composed, and whether individual transformations are provably correct.
By designing sequences of transformations that are as fine-grained as possible, we improved the reusability of these transformations, both between sequences of transformations and within such sequences.
Furthermore, this design decision increased the number of transformations with straightforward correctness proofs and reduced the number of proof obligations for the proofs of the larger transformation steps.

Given the large number of straightforward proofs, we consider investigating the application of automated theorem proving to be a promising direction for future research.
Furthermore, the work presented in this chapter does not take successful termination and time into account.
These problems also provide opportunities for future research.
Finally, we want to investigate the generalization of the approach to other DSMLs.
