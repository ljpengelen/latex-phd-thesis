\begin{abstract}
A formal definition of the semantics of a domain-specific modeling language~(DSML) is a key prerequisite for the verification of the correctness of models specified using this DSML and of transformations applied to these models.
For this reason, we implemented a prototype of the semantics of the Simple Language of Communicating Objects~(\SLCO).
Using this prototype, models specified in \SLCO can be transformed into labeled transition systems, which allows us to apply existing tools for visualization and verification to models with little or no further effort.
By first implementing this executable prototype, we are able to investigate a number of alternative design decisions before specifying a formal semantics for our DSML.
The prototype is implemented using the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment, an IDE for the algebraic specification language ASF+SDF, which offers efficient execution of the transformation as well as the ability to read models and produce LTSs without any additional preprocessing or postprocessing.
