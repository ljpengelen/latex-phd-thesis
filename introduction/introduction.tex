%The creation  of the \SLCO language was initiated within the Ideals project~\cite{Ideals2007} which required a UML-style language for specification of interactive software modules.
%Besides using the language for specification of such systems, it should have allowed for model simulation and performance analysis, for which reasons \SLCO was linked to the POOSL language and its support analysis tools.
%
Further development of the \SLCO language and its environment was motivated by the  Falcon project~\cite{Falcon2011}.
%The overall challenge of this project was developing a fully integrated and automated logistics warehouse of the future.
%One part of the project activities was centered on investigating the applicability of MDE techniques for modeling of
%composite system components and for their proper integration with advanced hardware components (like grippers).
%The underlying concept was that:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item[-] Warehouse control software is usually a collection of interacting components, which have the same (or very similar) functionality.
%\item[-] All components' activities are triggered by the reception of messages/signals from other components.
%\item[-] All system components have the same interfaces.
%\item[-] The overall system behavior is determined by the communication of the system components.
%\end{itemize}
%These concepts allowed for taking a rather abstract and simplified view at the warehouse software control systems focused more on the components interaction, which is exactly the domain of \SLCO.
%In order to do simple experiments we have built a simple conveyor belt system using Lego Mindstorms\footnote{\url{http://mindstorms.lego.com/}}.
%The software models for this simple system can be modeled in \SLCO.
%From these models we can generate the executable code to control the conveyor belt system.
%This well demonstrate that by shifting the problem domain towards the communication between components, we could (can) abstract away from concepts not relevant for the communication, in this particular case, from conveyor belt related concepts and concepts like motors and sensors.




%Besides developing a language, the driving idea was to develop an %environment which, among other things,
%allows automated generation of various refined models for different %purposes from a \emph{single} abstract $\SLCO$ model:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item automated generation of models for model (simulation) analysis %andx
%\item variants of executable code for different platforms.
%\end{itemize}
