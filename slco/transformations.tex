\section{Model Transformations}
\label{sec:slco:model-transformations}
Two types of model transformations are applied to transform \SLCO models to models or implementations in one of the target languages: endogenous transformations and exogenous transformations.
The input and output language of an endogenous model transformation is the same, whereas exogenous model transformations transform models from one language to another language~\cite{Mens:2006:TMT:1706639.1706924}.
The endogenous transformations are used to refine \SLCO models by bridging the semantic and platform gaps.
After all gaps have been bridged, the straightforward exogenous transformations can be applied.
