\subsection{Exogenous Transformations}
\label{sec:slco:exogenous}
Each of the following exogenous model transformations takes an \SLCO model as input and produces a model or an implementation in one of the target languages.
Because of the gaps described in Section~\ref{sec:slco:language-gaps}, the \SLCO model provided as input must be specified using a subset of \SLCO that matches the capabilities of the target language and platform.
Any model that is specified using constructs that have no direct counterparts in the target language must first be refined using the transformations described in Section~\ref{sec:slco:endogenous}.

    .
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{listing}

Because of the gaps between \SLCO and \POOSL, the transformation from \SLCO to \POOSL is restricted to models that contain only synchronous channels.
An example of the output of this transformation is shown in Listing~\ref{lst:slco:POOSLModel}.
This fragment of a \POOSL model is the result of applying the transformation to a slightly modified version of the model of Figures~\ref{fig:slco:SLCOExampleCommunication}, \ref{fig:slco:SLCOExampleStructure}, and~\ref{fig:slco:SLCOExampleSMS}.
The model has been modified by replacing all asynchronous channels by synchronous channels.

The transformation transforms each \SLCO class to a \POOSL process class.
Lines~2 to~16 of Listing~\ref{lst:slco:POOSLModel} show the process class that represents the \SLCO class~\SLCOClass{P}.
The state machines of each class are transformed to a number of process methods, one for each state.
The method in lines~11 to~13 represents the state~\SLCOState{Rec1}, the method in lines~14 to~16 represents the state~\SLCOState{SendRec}, and the method in lines~18 to~20 represents the state~\SLCOState{Com0}.
Besides this, an additional process method is generated for each class, which calls all process methods representing the initial states of the state machines of the class.
These additional process methods also initialize the variables of the classes and state machines to their initial values, if applicable.
Lines~8 to~10 show the process method that initializes the variable~\SLCOVariable{m} of class~\SLCOClass{P} and calls the process methods that represent the initial states of its state machines as part of a parallel composition.

Since each \SLCO class corresponds to exactly one \POOSL process class, it is clear that the global variables of an \SLCO class can be represented by variables of the corresponding \POOSL class.
An \SLCO state machine, however, is represented by multiple process methods, and a group of process methods within a process class cannot share variables that are inaccessible by other process methods of that class.
For this reason, the local variables of \SLCO state machines have to be represented by variables of process classes too.
These variables can no longer be considered to be local to a certain state machine, since all the process methods of a class can access them, even those representing other state machines of the same class.
Line~3 shows the declaration of the \POOSL variables representing the global \SLCO variable~\SLCOVariable{m} and the local \SLCO variable~\SLCOVariable{s} of state machine~\SLCOStateMachine{SendRec}.

States with a single outgoing transition are translated to process methods containing a single sequence of statements.
This sequence of statements represents the outgoing transition.
Line~12 shows the sequence of statements representing the outgoing transition of state~\SLCOState{Rec1}, and line~15 shows the sequence of statements representing the outgoing transition of state~\SLCOState{SendRec}.

States with multiple outgoing transitions are translated to process methods containing a select statement.
Each of the alternatives of such a select statement represents one of the outgoing transitions.
Line~19 shows the select statement representing the outgoing transitions of state~\SLCOState{Com0}.
The semantics of the \POOSL select statement is as follows.
Each of the alternatives of a select statement is a sequence of statements.
If one or more of these sequences starts with a statement that is enabled, one of these sequences is chosen non-deterministically and executed.
If none of the statements are enabled, the select statement is blocked until one of the statements it contains becomes enabled.

As mentioned above, each transition is transformed to a sequence of statements.
If a transition leads to an ordinary state, the sequence of statements representing this transition ends with a process method call.
This process method call calls the method representing the target state of the transition.
Line~12 shows the sequence of statements that represents the transition from state~\SLCOState{Rec1} to itself.
If a transition leads to a final state, this process method call is omitted.
The first alternative of the select statement on line~19 shows an example of this situation.
After 5~ms, the method representing state~\SLCOState{Com0} terminates.

\POOSL does not offer the form of conditional signal reception that uses expressions as arguments to limit the types of signals that can be received.
For this reason, auxiliary variables are introduced to mimic this form of conditional signal reception.
Lines~11 and~12 show how variable~\POOSLVariable{var\_1} is used to do so.

Lines~23 and~24 show that objects~\SLCOObject{p} and~\SLCOObject{q} are declared to be instances of classes~\SLCOClass{P} and~\SLCOClass{Q}, and that channels~\SLCOChannel{c1}, \SLCOChannel{c2}, and~\SLCOChannel{c3} are connected to the ports of these objects.

\subsubsection{Transforming \SLCO to \NQC}
\label{sec:slco:transformation-to-nqc}

The transformation from \SLCO to \NQC transforms \SLCO models to \NQC implementations, provided that the following two conditions hold.
First, all objects describing the behavior of the controllers must communicate with each other via asynchronous, lossy channels.
Second, all communication between these objects and the object(s) representing the hardware environment takes place over synchronous channels.

\begin{figure}[hbt]

\end{figure}

  \lstset{

  \begin{lstlisting}
    ...
    task AR() {
      int b = 0; int temp;
      AR:
        temp = Message();
        if (
          temp != 0 && ((temp & 112) / 16) == 0 && ((temp & 128) / 128) == b
        ) {
          name = 2; abl = 1; goto Ack;
        }
        temp = Message();
        if (
          temp != 0 && ((temp & 112) / 16) == 0 && ((temp & 128) / 128) == (1 - b)
        ) {
          goto AR;
        }
      goto AR;
      Ack:
        if (abl == 2) {
          abl = 3; /* skip */; until (abl == 0); b = 1 - b; goto AR;
        }
      goto Ack;
    }
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{listing}

Figure~\ref{fig:slco:CABP} shows the state machine of object~\SLCOObject{ar} that is part of the implementation of the CABP introduced in Section~\ref{subsubsec:slco:ll} after merging it with objects~\SLCOObject{a} and~\SLCOObject{sender}.
Listing~\ref{lst:slco:NQCCode} shows a fragment of \NQC code that is the result of applying the transformation from \SLCO to \NQC to a model containing the merged objects.

Every state machine that describes the behavior of an object in an \SLCO model is transformed into an \NQC task.
Lines~2 to~23 show the task that represents the state machine of Figure~\ref{fig:slco:CABP}.
Line~3 shows the declaration and initialization of local variable~\SLCOVariable{b} and auxiliary variable~\NQCVariable{temp}.
The purpose of auxiliary variable~\NQCVariable{temp} is explained below.
Global variables of \SLCO objects, such as~\SLCOVariable{abl} and~\SLCOVariable{name} in Figure~\ref{fig:slco:CABP}, are represented by global variables of \NQC programs, and are not shown in Listing~\ref{lst:slco:NQCCode}.

Each state is represented by a label, followed by sequences of statements that represent the outgoing transitions of the state, and a goto statement that jumps back to the label.
Lines~4 to~17 show the labeled sequence of statements representing state~\SLCOState{AR}, and lines~18 to~22 represent state~\SLCOState{Ack}.

If the statements of an \SLCO transition start with a statement that might block execution, this statement is translated to an \NQC if statement and the remaining \SLCO statements are translated to \NQC statements that form the body of this if statement.
In case the first statement is a signal reception statement, the if statement is preceded by a call to the API function~\NQCFunction{Message}.
The purpose of this API call is explained below.
Lines~5 to~10,~11 to~16, and~19 to~21 represent the transitions of the state machine in Figure~\ref{fig:slco:CABP}.
The remaining statements that are part of an \SLCO transition are translated as follows.
Assignments in \SLCO are translated to assignments in \NQC, as shown in lines~9 and~20.
Expressions and signal receptions are translated to until statements, as shown in line~20.
Statements that send signals are not shown in this example.
They are translated to calls to the API function~\NQCFunction{SendMessage}, using the encoding explained below.

An RCX controller can only send and receive integer values over its infrared port.
Since signals in \SLCO consist of a name and possibly a number of arguments, they have to be encoded such that they can be represented as a single integer before they can be sent, and they have to be decoded after being received.
Lines~5 and~11 show that first the auxiliary variable~\NQCVariable{temp} is used to store the value of the integer that has been received last.
Then, this integer is decoded as shown in lines~7 and~13.
The encoding of a signal, which is not shown in this example, is done using a similar procedure.
The actual sending and receiving of integer values is done via API calls to the functions~\NQCFunction{Message} and~\NQCFunction{SendMessage}, as mentioned above.

In addition to an \SLCO model, the transformation from \SLCO to \NQC also takes a mapping from elements in the \SLCO model to concepts of \NQC as input.
Listing~\ref{lst:slco:SLCO2NQCMapping} shows a part of the mapping for the model described in Section~\ref{sec:slco:sequences}.
For each class that needs to be transformed to an \NQC program, this mapping defines how some of the signals of an \SLCO model correspond to information received from sensors and commands sent to motors.
Each signal that is not mentioned in this mapping is assumed to be part of the communication between controllers via infrared and is translated accordingly, as described above.

\begin{listing}
  \lstset{
    language=slco2nqc,
    label=lst:slco:SLCO2NQCMapping,
    caption=Part of a mapping from \SLCO to \NQC,

  }
  \begin{lstlisting}
    class Middle

        Motor -> OutB 7
      port2sensor

        Motor Right -> On Forward

      signal2sensor
        Sensor Block -> Below -10
        Sensor BlockPassed -> Above -2
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{listing}

In line~3, port~\SLCOPort{Motor} of an \SLCO model is mapped to output port~\NQCPort{OutB} of a Lego Mindstorms controller.
The speed of the motor is set to 7.
In line~5, \SLCO port~\SLCOPort{Sensor} is mapped to input port~\NQCPort{Sensor2} of a Lego Mindstorms controller, which is connected to a light sensor.
Signals named~\SLCOSignalName{Left}, \SLCOSignalName{Right}, and~\SLCOSignalName{Middle} sent over port~\SLCOPort{Motor} are mapped to commands for a motor in lines~7 to~9.
Lines~11 and~12 show how signals named~\SLCOSignalName{Block} and~\SLCOSignalName{BlockPassed} are mapped to information received from sensors.
In line~11, for example, receiving a signal named~\SLCOSignalName{Block} is mapped to the event that the value transmitted by the sensor connected to port~\NQCPort{Sensor2} drops below $-10$.

\subsubsection{Transforming SLCO to Promela}
\label{subsubsec:slco:transformation-to-promela}

The transformation from \SLCO to \Promela transforms \SLCO models containing only synchronous channels and asynchronous, lossless channels to \Promela models.
Listing~\ref{lst:slco:PromelaModel} shows a fragment of a \Promela model that is the result of applying this transformation to a slightly modified version of the \SLCO model described in Figures~\ref{fig:slco:SLCOExampleCommunication}, \ref{fig:slco:SLCOExampleStructure}, and~\ref{fig:slco:SLCOExampleSMS}.
Because \Promela does not support the more general form of conditional signal reception, the condition~$\SLCOVariable{m} \geqop 0$ is removed from the signal reception in the \SLCO model.
Additionally, the asynchronous, lossy channel is replaced by an asynchronous, lossless channel.

\begin{listing}
  \lstset{
    language=promela,
    label=lst:slco:PromelaModel,
    caption=Part of a \Promela model,
    numbers=left
  }
  \begin{lstlisting}
    mtype {S, P, Q, T, a}
    int p_m = 0
    chan c1_q2p = [1] of {mtype, bool}
    chan c3_1_q2p = [0] of {mtype, mtype}
    chan c3_2_q2p = [0] of {mtype, mtype}
    ...
    active [1] proctype p_Rec1() {
      Label_Rec1: {
        if :: {c1_q2p?P,eval(false); goto Label_Rec1} fi
      }
    }

    active [1] proctype p_Rec2() {
      Label_Rec2: {
        if :: {c2_q2p?Q,p_m; p_m = p_m + 1; goto Label_Rec2} fi
      }
    }
    ...
    active [1] proctype q_Com() {
      mtype q_s;
      Label_Com0: {
        if :: {skip; goto Label_Com2}
           :: {c1_q2p!P,true; goto Label_Com1}
        fi
      }
      Label_Com1: {
        if ::
          {c2_q2p!Q,5; c3_1_p2q?S,q_s; c3_2_q2p!T,q_s; goto Label_Com2}
        fi
      }
      Label_Com2: skip
    }
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{listing}

For each object in an \SLCO model, the state machines that describe its behavior are transformed to \Promela processes.
Lines~7 to~11 in Listing~\ref{lst:slco:PromelaModel} show the process that represents state machine~\SLCOStateMachine{Rec1} of object~\SLCOObject{p}, lines~13 to~17 show the process that represents state machine~\SLCOStateMachine{Rec2} of object~\SLCOObject{p}, and lines~19 to~32 show the process that represents state machine~\SLCOStateMachine{Com} of object~\SLCOObject{q}.

Channels between objects in \SLCO are transformed to channels between processes in \Promela.
Line~3 shows the declaration of the \Promela channel representing the \SLCO channel named~\SLCOChannel{c1}.
The 1 between square brackets indicates that this channel is asynchronous.
The declaration specifies that this channel is suited for messages consisting of two parts: a symbolic name (mtype) and a Boolean value.
Lines~4 and~5 show the declaration of two channels representing the \SLCO channel named~\SLCOChannel{c3}.
Although \Promela offers bidirectional channels, a separate channel is declared for each direction.
This is done because the semantics of channels in \Promela differs from their semantics in \SLCO.
In \SLCO, an object can only receive signals sent by another object.
In \Promela, however, a process can retrieve a message from a channel that it has sent over this channel itself.
For this reason, we introduce two \Promela channels for each bidirectional \SLCO channel.
Each of the \Promela channels is used only to communicate in one direction, which means that a process uses the channel either to send messages or to receive messages, but not both.
The 0 between square brackets indicates that this channel is synchronous.

The local variables of state machines are represented by local variables of processes, as shown in line~20.
Global variables of \SLCO objects are represented by global variables of the \Promela model.
They are accessible by all processes in the model.
On line~2, global variable~\SLCOVariable{m} of object~\SLCOObject{p} is declared.

Ordinary states are transformed to labeled selection statements, and final states are transformed to labeled skip statements.
Lines~21 to~25 represent state~\SLCOState{Com0} of object~\SLCOObject{q}, lines~26 to~30 represent state~\SLCOState{Com1}, and line~31 represents state~\SLCOState{Com2}.

Every outgoing transition of a state is represented by an alternative of the selection statement that represents this state.
Each of these alternatives ends with a goto statement to the label representing the target state of the transition.
State~\SLCOState{Rec1} of object~\SLCOObject{p} has only one outgoing transition, as shown in line~9.
State~\SLCOState{Com0} of object~\SLCOObject{q} has two outgoing transitions.
The transition to state~\SLCOState{Com2} is shown in line~22, and the transition to state~\SLCOState{Com1} is shown in line~23.

The semantics of the selection statement is such that it will non-deterministically execute one of the alternatives for which the first statement is executable, and it will block if none of these statements are executable.
The statements of a transition are transformed to \Promela statements in a straightforward way.
Expressions and assignments in \SLCO are translated to equivalent expressions and assignments in \Promela, as shown in line~15.
A signal reception is transformed to a receive statement, as shown in line~9.
The receive statement~\PromelaReceive{c1\_q2p}{P,\PromelaEval(\PromelaFalse)} represents the reception of signals named~\SLCOSignalName{P} with an argument that must be equal to~\SLCOFalse.
A \Promela receive statement blocks until it is able to receive a message over a channel.
A send signal statement is transformed to a send statement in a similar fashion, as shown in lines~23 and~28.
