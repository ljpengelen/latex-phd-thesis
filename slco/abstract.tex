\begin{abstract}
The Simple Language of Communicating Objects~(\SLCO) is a small domain-specific modeling language for the specification of systems consisting of objects that operate in parallel and communicate with each other.
Via a number of model transformations, \SLCO models can be simulated, executed, and verified.
In this chapter, we describe the language itself, the languages used for simulation, execution, and verification, and the model transformations related to the language.
Additionally, we describe the implementation of the language and its transformations.
This chapter serves as an introduction for Chapters~\ref{chap:exploring-boundaries} to~\ref{chap:iterative-dsl-evolution}.
Chapter~\ref{chap:exploring-boundaries} uses \SLCO for a case study, and Chapters~\ref{chap:prototype-semantics}, \ref{chap:reusable-correct-transformations}, and~\ref{chap:iterative-dsl-evolution} describe its development.
In this chapter, we provide an informal description of the semantics of \SLCO.
A formal semantics is presented in Appendix~\ref{ap:sos-slco}.
