\section{Simplified \SLCO}
\label{sec:SLCO:simplified_slco}
The \SLCO metamodel discussed in Section~\ref{sec:slco:metamodel} and the communication diagrams shown in the rest of this chapter allow a transition to have multiple statements.
When a transition is made from one state to another, the statements that are part of this transition are executed one by one.
We have already mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:slco:metamodel} that the execution of statements related to a given transition can be interleaved by the execution of statements related to a transition of a concurrent state machine.
In fact, after executing one of the statements related to a transition, an implicit intermediate state is reached.
In some cases, it is convenient to make all these implicit intermediate states explicit.
Figure~\ref{fig:slco:SLCOExampleSMSMinimized} show simplified versions of the state machines of Figure~\ref{fig:slco:SLCOExampleSMS}.
In these simplified state machines, each transition has at most one statement.
Because of this, the state machines have no implicit intermediate states.

Additionally, the simplified state machines only use the general form of conditional signal reception.
To replace the shorthand notation originally used by state machine~\SLCOStateMachine{Rec1}, an auxiliary variable~\SLCOVariable{v} is introduced.
Furthermore, the expression~\SLCOTrue is added as a condition to the signal reception statements of state machines~\SLCOStateMachine{SendRec} and~\SLCOStateMachine{Com}.

The version of \SLCO that allows only these simplified state machines is used in Chapter~\ref{chap:prototype-semantics}, which discusses the process of prototyping the semantics of the language.
The formal semantics of \SLCO discussed in Appendix~\ref{ap:sos-slco} and applied in Chapter~\ref{chap:reusable-correct-transformations} is also based on this simplified version of \SLCO.
