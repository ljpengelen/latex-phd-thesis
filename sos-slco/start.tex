This appendix discusses the formal operational semantics of \SLCO and is based on the work described in Chapter~\ref{chap:prototype-semantics}.
However, successful termination and time are not taken into account.
A more concise description of the semantics presented in this appendix is given in Section~\ref{sec:reusable-correct-transformations:operational_semantics}.
We start with a description of the syntax of \SLCO, followed by a description of the rules that define its operational semantics.
Finally, we discuss the initialization of the evaluation functions that are used in these rules.
