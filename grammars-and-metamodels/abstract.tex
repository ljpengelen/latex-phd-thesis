Graphical diagrams are the main modeling constructs offered by the popular modeling language \UML.
Because textual representations of models also have their benefits, such as conciseness, we investigated the integration of textual and graphical modeling languages, by comparing two approaches.
One approach uses grammarware, and the other uses modelware.
As a case study, we implemented two versions of a textual alternative for activity diagrams, which is an example of a \emph{surface language}.
This chapter describes our surface language, the two approaches, and the two implementations that follow these approaches.
