\begin{abstract}
In model-driven software development, models and model transformations are used to create software.
To automatically generate correct software from abstract models by means of model transformations, these transformations must preserve the desirable properties of the initial models.
In this chapter, we propose an incremental model checking technique to determine whether model transformations are property preserving.
We use labeled transition systems (LTSs) to represent the individual components of models, and formalize model transformations as transformations of LTSs.
Checking whether a transformation preserves certain properties involves checking bisimilarity between transformed and new behavior only, instead of comparing the behavior of entire models before and after transformation.
Thus, it never requires exploring unchanged behavior twice.
We describe our approach and provide experimental results to show its usefulness.
