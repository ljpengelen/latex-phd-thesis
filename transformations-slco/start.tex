\begin{abstract}
This appendix provides a detailed description of the two versions of the transformation that simulates synchronous communication over an asynchronous channel.
An informal description of both versions of this transformation is given in Section~\ref{subsubsec:slco:sync2async}.
Additionally, Section~\ref{sec:reusable-correct-transformations:model_transformations} provides a concise discussion of the description presented in this appendix.
We use the syntax defined in Appendix~\ref{ap:sos-slco} to describe the two versions of the transformation.
